Hey pimps, so this is going to be a reference for the java API page to look over.

The webiste is located here: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/

Do some research with some of these to figure out what they do and if they can help with making the game.

Some API's such as Graphics2D, GridLayout, and so on will obviously be neccessary considering that we are creating an object.
