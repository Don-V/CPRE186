Game Title: Light

Setting: 8x8 board with mirrors "/" or "\". There is a starting square and an ending square.

  an edge or gets to the ending square. 
  
Game play: There will be levels and the player changes the mirrors to his/her desire then click the "shoot" button that sends out
  the light.
